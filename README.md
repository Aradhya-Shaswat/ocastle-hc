# OCastle!

Retro-style 1970s–1980s vector arcade lander. Minimal, high-difficulty, score-chasing.

How to run

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. On Windows PowerShell you can run:

```powershell
start index.html
```

Controls

- Left/Right arrows: rotate
- Up arrow: thrust (consumes fuel)
- R: restart

Gameplay

- Land on flat pads with low vertical speed and near-horizontal orientation.
- Hard landings or crashes instantly destroy the craft and restart the game.
- Each successful landing grants points and increases round difficulty (more gravity, less starting fuel).

Controller Supported!
